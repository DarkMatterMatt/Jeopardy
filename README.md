# Quinzical

JavaFX based quiz game created by Hajin Kim and Matt Moran.


## Aim of the game

The aim of the game is to take home the cash! Answer questions correctly to increase your winnings,
but be warned, incorrect answers will penalise you!


## Features

- Play more than 80 unique questions over 7 categories
- Customize you own categories and questions
- Amazing interface
- Cross-platform support
- Advanced text-to-speech support for reading questions (`festival` must be in PATH)
- Secret-sauce custom NZ voice with accurate pronunciation of MƒÅori words
- Resizable and draggable window
- Questions support have multiple answers - never be incorrectly marked!


## Categories & Questions

The game reads categories from a `./categories` folder (relative to the current working directory).

Inside this folder, there should be one or more files which are named as their category.
<br>Example: `./categories/animals` is the `animals` category.

Each file is in a pipe-delimited format without a header row. The format is `question|answer1|answer2|...answerN`.
<br>Example: `What is the highest mountain in New Zealand|Mount Cook|Aorangi|Aoraki`.

Changes to categories and questions will not be processed until you reset the game.
