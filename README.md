## How to run it

Make sure you meet the __Runtime Requirements__.

You must have the following folders/files in one folder:
- `quinzical.jar` runnable jar file containing compiled JavaFX quiz application
- `categories` folder containing questions and icon resources
- `javafx-sdk-11.0.2` folder that contains JavaFX libraries
- `quinzical.sh` containing script that runs the application. 

**Option 1: Run with the script file**

Move into the folder that contains all of the folders/files above and run the script.

To do this, enter these two commands into the bash (assuming your current directory is the folder that contains the above folders/files):
- `chmod 777 quinzical.sh`
- `./script.sh`

**Option 2: Run from the runnable jar (for experts!)**

Download the [latest compiled release](https://github.com/SOFTENG206-2020/assignment-3-and-project-team-24/releases/latest/download/quinzical.jar).
Then run `java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib/ --add-modules javafx.controls -jar quinzical.jar`.
 
Don't have JavaFX? Check out [jfxRunner](https://github.com/DarkMatterMatt/jfxrunner/releases/latest), which handles JavaFX
for you. Just run `java -jar jfxrunner.jar quinzical.jar` (you might have to wait for a moment while JavaFX is downloaded!).

## Customize Questions and Categories
The game reads categories from a `./categories` folder (relative to the current working directory).

Inside this folder, there should be one or more files which are named as their category.
<br>Example: `./categories/animals` is the `animals` category.

Each file is in a pipe-delimited format without a header row. The format is `question|answer1|answer2|...answerN`.
<br>Example: `What is the highest mountain in New Zealand|Mount Cook|Aorangi|Aoraki`.

Changes to categories and questions will not be processed until you reset the game.
